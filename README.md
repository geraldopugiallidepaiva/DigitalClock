# DigitalClock

This is a Multi-function Shield API combined with the internal RTC for STM32 microcontrollers based on the STM32F1 HAL library. As a result, it makes possible to implement common digital clock features to designs, such as time displaying, alarm setting, timing and time counting.

It was developed as an assignment for the subject Embedded Systems Programming at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais - Prof. Ricardo de Oliveira Duarte - Department of Electronic Engineering

**Attention:** 
This library was developed for the Multi-function shield connected to the NUCLEO-64 Arduino connectors.
When using the same devices specified above, the corresponding ports and pins are defined by default. When using a different board or shield, it is mandatory to initialize the respective ports and pins for each device with the appropriate funcion.
