# DigitalClock

This is a Multi-function Shield API combined with the internal RTC for STM32 microcontrollers based on the STM32F1 HAL library.

## Introduction
This API was developed as an assignment for the subject Embedded Systems Programming at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais - Prof. Ricardo de Oliveira Duarte - Department of Electronic Engineering

## API functions:

### void function()
Description

## Example
This library is originally developed and tested on the STM32 Nucleo-64 development board with a STM32F103RB MCU.
The example shown below use the Multi-function shield connected to the NUCLEO-64 Arduino connectors, as shown in the following image.

**Attention:** 
This library was developed for the Multi-function shield connected to the NUCLEO-64 Arduino connectors.
When using the same devices specified above, the corresponding ports and pins are defined by default. When using a different board or shield, it is mandatory to initialize the respective ports and pins for each device.
